# dotfiles
This repo represents my OpenBox dotfiles and some little scripts i wrote.
To install this config of mine, simply copy the content of the repo directly into your home directory after modifying them.

# Alyways treat copying foreign files with caution!

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/thokis/dotfiles.git .thokis_dotfiles
    $ cd .thokis_dotfiles
    
Now you should be able to edit the files in the .config and .script_dir directorys. After editing the files run

    $ cp -r ~/.thokis_dotifles/* ~/
    
Now you should have a working Openbox config.
